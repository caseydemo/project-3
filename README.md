# The "heroes" of the first law series

So in the first law book series the author shifts perspective many times to give an interesting and layered view to the situations they run into. He does a great job of making all the perspecitves seem plausible - I could see the good in even the worst characters. However, I found myself drawn most to the stories about the men of the north. 

The men of the north are strong, hardy and gruff who have only known war their entire lives. Honor is valued above power or wealth and they are generally a trust worthy people. But to call them heroes just seems a bit weird. Whatever I like em. So... yeah... these are like their facebook pages. lol selfie!

I got most of my content from the [First Law Wikia](http://firstlaw.wikia.com/wiki/First_Law_Wiki) and pictures from various other places on the interwebs.
